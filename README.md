## Acknowledgements

This project is more difficult for me as I live in Ventura County California and our community is facing catastrophic wildfires. We are living with school closures, loved ones under mandatory evacuation and have intermittent disruption in internet service. Never the less, I am determined to complete as much of the degree as possible. That being said, I'm going to take this space to acknowledge the firefighters working night and day to protect our homes and our community.

I used the following tutorials:
